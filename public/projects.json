        "description": "This project features a piano that can be played using a qwerty keyboard. The keyboard inputs can be recorded, and will be added to a grid in real time, which can be edited using a mouse. The contents of the grid can then be played back to the user. Functionality for saving and loading from a database exists but is not active due to online database restrictions.",
